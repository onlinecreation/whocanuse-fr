## Reporting Bugs
[Github issues](https://github.com/CoreyGinnivan/whocanuse/issues/) are the preferred channel for submitting bug reports.

Here are some tips on writing a good bug report:
- Use a **clear and descriptive title** that identifies the problem
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain the behavior you expected to see instead** and why
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** where appropriate
- List the **environments/browsers/OS** where you experienced the problem

These details will help people troubleshoot any potential bugs

## Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/CoreyGinnivan/whocanuse/issues).

Suggested enhancements are welcome, though it's up to you to make a case for the merits of the feature. There's a better chance of the enhancment being considered when you provide sufficient detail and context :slightly_smiling_face:

Here are some tips on writing a good enhancement suggestion:

## Contributing to code

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this free series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://kcd.im/pull-request)

[Issues](https://github.com/CoreyGinnivan/whocanuse/issues) tagged with the following labels are good places to start:

- `help wanted` - issues we're actively looking for help with!
- `bug` - something isn't working as expected
- `enhancement` - issues asking for a new feature to be added, or an existing one to be extended or modified

The following provides some guidelines for pull requests:

- Express your interest on an issue before starting on any significant PR
- For smaller tasks feel free to go ahead and submit a PR
- Give your PR a clear title and description
- Each PR should focus on only one feature/fix. (Multiple things = multiple PRs)
- If you're solving an [issue](https://github.com/CoreyGinnivan/whocanuse/issues/), link to it in your PR
- Check the "Allow edits by maintainers" checkbox for collaboration
